#  Sales Dashboard | Power BI Project

This repository contains my **Car Sales Dashboard** project, designed to analyze and visualize key sales metrics for a car dealership using **Power BI**, **DAX**, and **Excel**. This project highlights my proficiency in data cleaning, advanced data modeling, and dynamic visualization, delivering actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making and optimize sales strategy.

---

## üìä Project Overview

The **Car Sales Dashboard** was built to track and analyze critical KPIs for a car dealership, providing real-time insights into sales performance across different dimensions. Key metrics include **Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales**, **average transaction prices**, and **units sold**, along with detailed breakdowns by **body style**, **color**, and **region**.

---

## üöÄ Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI:** Used for dashboard creation, data modeling, and interactive visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Over 50 DAX formulas were employed to compute KPIs, perform aggregations, and create custom measures.
- **Excel:** Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were executed in Excel to ensure data quality before importing into Power BI.

## üìà Key Features

1. **Dynamic KPI Tracking:**  
   - Implemented measures for YTD and MTD **Total Sales** ($371.2M YTD), **Average Price** ($28K), and **Total Cars Sold** (13.3K).
   - Added **Year-over-Year (YOY)** growth indicators to provide a comparison with previous periods, supporting trend analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning with Excel:**  
   - Pre-processed raw sales data using **Excel functions** to handle missing values, standardize formats, and optimize for Power BI integration.
   - Enhanced data accuracy and streamlined data imports, preparing a robust dataset for dashboard visualizations.

3. **Advanced DAX Calculations:**  
   - Utilized **DAX** to create complex calculated fields, including custom aggregations, filters, and time-based calculations (e.g., YTD and YOY growth).
   - Leveraged DAX to build dynamic slicers, enabling users to filter data by attributes such as **Body Style**, **Dealer Name**, and **Region**.

4. **Interactive Visualizations:**  
   - Created multiple visualizations, including:
     - **Line Chart:** Showcasing weekly trends in YTD sales.
     - **Pie Charts:** Displaying sales distribution by body style and color.
     - **Map Chart:** Visualizing sales data across dealer regions, highlighting geographical trends.
     - **Tabular View:** Detailing individual sales records, including attributes like **Car Model**, **Color**, **Total Sales**, and **Dealer Region**.

5. **Impactful Insights:**  
   - The dashboard provides insights that contributed to a **23.59% increase in sales insights** and a **19.73% improvement in car sales visibility** across regions.
   - Enabled the dealership to make data-driven adjustments to their sales strategy based on real-time metrics and detailed segmentation.
